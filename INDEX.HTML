    <h1>**Global warming** refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the **greenhouse effect**.</h1>

<h2>### 🌍 Key Causes of Global Warming:</h2> <br>
1. **Burning of fossil fuels** (coal, oil, natural gas) for energy and transportation.
2. **Deforestation**, which reduces the number of trees that absorb CO₂.
3. **Industrial activities** that release greenhouse gases.
4. **Agriculture**, especially livestock farming, which emits methane.

<h3>### 🌡️ Effects of Global Warming:</h3> <br.
- **Rising sea levels** due to melting glaciers and polar ice.
- **Extreme weather events** like heatwaves, floods, and hurricanes.
- **Loss of biodiversity** as habitats change or disappear.
- **Ocean acidification** affecting marine life.
- **Impact on agriculture** and food security.

<h4>### 🌱 What Can Be Done?</h4> <br>
- Shift to **renewable energy** sources like solar and wind.
- Promote **energy efficiency** in homes and industries.
- Encourage **reforestation** and protect natural ecosystems.
- Reduce **carbon footprint** through lifestyle changes (e.g., using public transport, reducing meat consumption).
- Support **climate policies** and international agreements like the Paris Agreement.
