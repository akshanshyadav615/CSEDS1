</head> <HTML> GLOBAL WARMING </hTML>
    <P> Global warming is a critical environmental issue caused by the increase in greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the Earth's atmosphere.<br> These gases trap heat, leading to a rise in global temperatures. The primary sources of these emissions are human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes, and agriculture.<br>

The consequences of global warming are widespread and severe.<br> It leads to melting polar ice caps and glaciers, causing sea levels to rise and threatening coastal communities. Weather patterns become more extreme, with more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms. Ecosystems are disrupted, endangering wildlife and biodiversity.<br>

Human health is also at risk due to increased air pollution, heat-related illnesses, and the spread of diseases. Agriculture suffers from changing rainfall patterns and reduced crop yields, affecting food security. Water resources are strained, and many regions face the threat of scarcity.<br>

To combat global warming, global cooperation is essential. Solutions include transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, improving energy efficiency, protecting forests, and adopting sustainable practices in industries and daily life. Governments, businesses, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing carbon footprints.<br>

Education and awareness are key to driving change.<br> By understanding the causes and effects of global warming, people can make informed choices and support policies that protect the environment. Immediate and sustained action is necessary to limit temperature rise, preserve natural resources, and ensure a livable planet for future generations.<br>

 Causes of Global Warming <br>
Burning of Fossil Fuels: Coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, heat, and transportation.<br>
Deforestation: Trees absorb COâ‚‚; cutting them down increases carbon in the atmosphere.<br>
Industrial Activities: Factories release greenhouse gases.<br>
Agriculture: Livestock produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas.<br>

<p>Effects of Global Warming<br>
Rising Sea Levels: Melting glaciers and polar ice caps.<br>
Extreme Weather: More frequent heatwaves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes.<br>
Loss of Biodiversity: Many species face extinction due to changing habitats.<br>
Impact on Agriculture: Crop failures and food shortages.<br>
Health Risks: Increased spread of diseases and heat-related illnesses.<br>

<p></p>Solutions to Global Warming<br>
Switch to Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.<br>
Energy Efficiency: Use energy-saving appliances and reduce wastage.<br>
Afforestation: Plant more trees and protect forests.<br>
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Minimize waste and promote sustainable practices.<br>
International Agreements: Support policies like the Paris Agreement.<br>
